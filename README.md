How does the weather affect the average number of car crashes in certain locations around the US?
By James Aretakis and Nnamdi Nwaenia


"What data will you collect from each API/website and store in a database?


The two APIs we will pull from are a United States weather data API and a car crash API. We will draw information on weather conditions in certain states and car crash information in those states, including the number of car crashes recorded in each state. 


"What data will you be calculating from the data in the database?


The main calculation will be the correlation between certain weather conditions and the number of car crashes that occur in those areas. The correlation will be calculated using the average amount of car crashes in each specific area, and weather trends in certain states. Then we will compare these two lines and make another plot to track their correlation, see what weather adversely affects car crashes, or if they affect them at all.


"What visualization package will you be using (Matplotlib, Plotly, Seaborn, etc)?"


We are most comfortable using Matplotlib, and it would also be perfect to track correlation and create different plots to analyze the correlation.


"What graphs/charts will you be creating?


We will create around 3 graphs analyzing how different weather patterns affect the number of car crashes that happen in a certain area, in our case, 3-4 main cities. We will also look into other reasons why these certain locations would have a lot of car crashes to rationalise our collected data. There will be a total of around 4-5 graphs that will answer the question of how weather affects the number of car crashes that occur in big cities.


"Who is responsible for what? Please note that all team members should do an equal amount of programming and total work."


Both of us will be doing equal work and will both organize the data sets so they are easily assessable and both contribute to the programming and overall conclusion.
