How do the fluctuations in gas prices and location affect the used car market?

By James Aretakis and Nnamdi Nwaenia

"What data will you collect from each API/website and store in a database? 

The two APIs we will pull from are a used car data API and a gas price API. We will draw information on Car Prices, Mileage, and price depression over time, along with basic make and model data. From the gas price API, we will be pulling data on fluctuating fuel costs to analyze how these fluctuating costs affect used car prices. 

"What data will you be calculating from the data in the database?

The main calculation will be the depression rate of the cars and how this rate correlates with the fluctuation of gas prices. The depression rate will be calculated using the Initial price - the resale price, divided by the initial price. Then we will compare these two lines and make another plot to track their correlation.

"What visualization package will you be using (Matplotlib, Plotly, Seaborn, etc)?"

We are most comfortable using Matplot and it would also be perfect to track correlation and create different plots to analyze the correlation.

"What graphs/charts will you be creating?

We will create around 3 graphs comparing the different type of cars to the fluctuation of gas prices then create a central graph that compares the over all depression rate of all used cars to the fluctuation of gas prices. We will be anylising price, condition, and location impact. There will be a total of around 5 graphs that will be anwsering the question of how does gas price fluctuation and location affect a Used cars condition and price.

"Who is responsible for what? Please note that all team members should do an equal amount of programming and total work."

Both of us will be doing equal work and will both orginise the data sets so they are easliy assessable and both contribute to the programming and overall conclusion.
